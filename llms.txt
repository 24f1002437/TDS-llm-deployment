# Instruction for Jules

# 1. Create a Python module 
Create a Python file called odd_even.py with a function:
def classify_numbers(nums: list[int]) -> list[str]
The function should return a list of strings where each number is classified as "odd" or "even".

# 2. Create tests 
Create test_odd_even.py with pytest tests for this function.
Include at least 3 test cases, including an empty list, all odd numbers, and all even numbers.

# 3. Create GitHub Actions workflow 
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file at .github/workflows/tests.yml
It should run pytest on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created.

# 4. Create README.md 
Create a professional README.md including:
- Project title: "Odd/Even Number Classifier"
- Short description
- How to run tests
- Example usage
- License section mentioning MIT
